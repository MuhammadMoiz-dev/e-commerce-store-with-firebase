## Overview

This project showcases an e‑commerce platform where users can sign up or log in, browse products, add them to a cart, and view a dashboard. Powered by Firebase for authentication, data storage, and real-time updates, the front-end is built with HTML, JavaScript, CSS (via Tailwind), and Firebase SDKs.

- **Firebase** – Backend services for Authentication, Firestore (or Realtime Database), and Hosting  
- **Project Assets**  
  - `icon.png` for branding  
  - Static files: `.html`, `app.js`

## Features

- **Product Browsing**: Display products (likely from Firebase) on a dashboard  
- **Add to Cart**: Users can add items to their cart (`addtocart.html`)
